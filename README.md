# Caravan Insurance Policy Prediction in R
## Introduction

This problem focuses on the prediction of probable customers buying caravan insurance. The data set provided was part of the CoIL challenge in 2000. There are two main components in the problem. Firstly, identifying the customers who would like to buy the caravan insurance, and secondly an explanation of the customer behaviour which helped us in predicting the above behaviour.

As the data consists of real world data, it has 86 variables, half of those relate to socio-demographic data whereas the other half relates to product ownership data. The training set consists of 5822 records, including the information of whether the customers hold a caravan insurance. The dataset for predictions have 4000 records, where the target variable is missing. The target variable for the predictions is present in another file.

For the prediction task it is expected to find the set of 800 customers out of the 4000 who are more likely to buy the caravan insurance policy.

For the description task, it is expected to be explaninable to a marketing professional, who is not expected to have any information about machine learning. The final outcome of Machine Learning is its profiatbility in business scenarios. Thus, an explanatory model is expected from a business perspective.
